\section{Conclusion}
In this article, we have made improvements based on the original dataset and model, and achieved certain results. We use the image prompt module to specify the appearance of video objects, the text prompt module to specify the behavior of the background or objects in the video, and finally generate the video. The experiment shows that our improvement has played a promoting role in improving the quality of video generation. At the same time, we discussed the technology of using text prompts and image prompts for video generation, introduced its value and limitations, and also pointed out the direction for the next step of work.
